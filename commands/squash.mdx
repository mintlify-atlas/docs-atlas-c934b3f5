## Overview

The `squash` command is the primary interface for Splat's AI-powered debugging. It executes your code, captures any errors that occur, and provides intelligent fixes based on comprehensive context analysis.

## Basic Usage

```bash
splat squash "<command>"
```

Run your application exactly as you normally would, but prefix it with `splat squash`:

```bash
splat squash "python3 main.py"
```

```bash
splat squash "npm start"
```

```bash
splat squash "python3 foo.py"
```

## How It Works

When you run `splat squash`, the tool:

1. **Executes your command** in a controlled subprocess environment
2. **Captures all output** including stdout, stderr, and return codes
3. **Parses error tracebacks** to identify affected files and line numbers
4. **Gathers context** from your codebase (respecting .gitignore)
5. **Analyzes with AI** using Groq's fast inference models
6. **Provides actionable fixes** with specific code suggestions

## Example Output

When Splat detects an error, it provides structured analysis:

```bash
$ splat squash "python3 test.py"

  Running: python3 test.py
  
  Error detected in test.py:2
  
  WHERE:
    File: test.py
    Line: 2
    
  WHAT:
    Error Type: SyntaxError
    Description: Unclosed parenthesis in print statement
    
  HOW:
    Suggested Fix:
    print("hello")
```

## Error Analysis

Splat's AI engine analyzes errors and returns:

- **WHERE**: Repository path, filename, and exact line number
- **WHAT**: Error type and clear explanation
- **HOW**: Line where error originated and suggested code solution

### Response Format

The AI response is structured as JSON internally:

```json
{
  "where": {
    "repository_path": "/absolute/path/to/repo",
    "file_name": "test.py",
    "line_number": "2"
  },
  "what": {
    "error_type": "SyntaxError",
    "description": "'(' was never closed in print statement"
  },
  "how": {
    "error_origination": "2",
    "suggested_code_solution": "print(\"hello\")"
  }
}
```

## Context Gathering

Splat automatically:

- Parses error stack traces to identify relevant files
- Respects your `.gitignore` to avoid sensitive data
- Uses `repomix` to package file context efficiently
- Sends only relevant code to the AI model

## Performance

Splat is optimized for speed:

- Uses **Groq** (llama3-70b-8192) for near-instant inference
- Captures output in real-time with threading
- Minimizes context sent to AI while maximizing relevance

## Use Cases

### Quick Bug Fixes

```bash
splat squash "python3 buggy_script.py"
```

Get instant explanations and fixes for syntax errors, runtime errors, and exceptions.

### Development Workflow

```bash
splat squash "python3 -m myapp.main"
```

Run your module entrypoint and debug any startup errors.

### Testing

```bash
splat squash "pytest tests/"
```

Analyze test failures with full context.

## Limitations

<Warning>
  Splat currently works best with scripts launched from the root directory. Sub-module entrypoints may not provide full context.
</Warning>

<Note>
  Suggested code fixes do not currently conform to your project's formatting configuration (e.g., Black, Prettier).
</Note>
