## Known Bugs

The following issues are currently known and being worked on:

<Warning>
  These limitations may affect your workflow. We recommend reviewing them before using Splat in production environments.
</Warning>

### Code Formatting Not Preserved

<Card title="Formatting Configuration" icon="code">
  **Issue:** Splat will not conform to any formatting configurations when inserting code.
  
  **Impact:** After Splat fixes your code, the formatting may not match your project's style guide or linter configuration.
  
  **Workaround:** Run your code formatter after Splat makes changes:
  ```bash
  # For Python projects
  black your_file.py
  
  # For JavaScript/TypeScript
  prettier --write your_file.js
  ```
</Card>

### Sub-module Entrypoint Issues

<Card title="Root Directory Requirement" icon="folder">
  **Issue:** Splat does not do well with running sub-module entrypoints that do not originate in the root directory.
  
  **Impact:** If your application entrypoint is in a subdirectory (e.g., `src/main.py`, `app/server.py`), Splat may fail to properly capture context or generate accurate fixes.
  
  **Workaround:** 
  - Run Splat from your project root directory
  - Create a wrapper script in the root that imports and runs your sub-module
  - Use relative paths from the root:
    ```bash
    splat squash "python3 app/main.py"
    ```
</Card>

## Limitations

### Context Gathering

- **Deep Dependency Trees:** Very large codebases with complex dependency graphs may hit context limits when using the `-r` flag
- **Binary Files:** Splat cannot analyze binary files or compiled code
- **Encrypted Files:** Files that require decryption are not accessible

### Error Detection

- **Runtime Errors Only:** Splat works best with runtime errors that produce stack traces
- **Logic Errors:** Silent logic errors without exceptions may not be detected
- **Performance Issues:** Slow code without errors won't trigger Splat's analysis

### Language Support

While Splat is designed primarily for Python:
- Other languages may have varying levels of support
- Stack trace parsing is optimized for Python error formats
- Multi-language projects may have reduced accuracy

## Upcoming Fixes

<Info>
  The development team is actively working on addressing these issues. Check the project repository for updates.

### Roadmap

- **Formatter Integration:** Support for detecting and applying project formatting rules
- **Sub-module Support:** Improved handling of non-root entrypoints
- **Configuration File:** `.splat` config file for project-specific settings
- **Extended Language Support:** Better multi-language stack trace parsing

## Reporting Issues

Found a bug not listed here? Please help improve Splat:

1. Check if the issue already exists in the repository
2. Gather the following information:
   - Operating system and version
   - Python version
   - Splat version
   - Complete error message or unexpected behavior
   - Minimal reproduction steps
3. Submit a detailed bug report following the [Contributing Guide](/advanced/contributing)

## Working Around Issues

General tips for avoiding known issues:

- Always run Splat from your project root directory
- Use a post-processing formatter for code style consistency
- Keep your dependencies up to date
- Test Splat on a branch before applying fixes to main
- Review generated fixes before committing them
