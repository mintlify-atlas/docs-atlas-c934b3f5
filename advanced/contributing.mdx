```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

  The following packages are required:
  
  - `click` - CLI framework
  - `repopack` - Repository packaging utilities
  - `setuptools` - Python package setup
  - `virtualenv` - Virtual environment management
  - `groq` - AI inference API
  - `fastapi` - Web framework

This allows you to make changes to the code and test them immediately without reinstalling.

### Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the project root:

```bash
GROQ_API_KEY=your_groq_api_key_here
```

Get your API key from the [Groq Console](https://console.groq.com/).

## Development Workflow

### 1. Create a Branch

Always create a new branch for your changes:

```bash
git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
```

Branch naming conventions:
- `feature/` - New features
- `fix/` - Bug fixes
- `docs/` - Documentation updates
- `refactor/` - Code refactoring

### 2. Make Your Changes

Follow these guidelines:

<CardGroup cols={2}>
  <Card title="Code Style" icon="paintbrush">
    - Use Black for Python formatting
    - Follow PEP 8 guidelines
    - Write clear, descriptive variable names
    - Add comments for complex logic
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Testing" icon="flask">
    - Test your changes thoroughly
    - Include edge cases
    - Verify existing tests still pass
    - Add tests for new features
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Documentation" icon="book">
    - Update relevant documentation
    - Add docstrings to functions
    - Update README if needed
    - Include usage examples
  </Card>
  
  <Card title="Git Commits" icon="code-commit">
    - Write clear commit messages
    - Use present tense ("Add feature")
    - Keep commits atomic
    - Reference issues when applicable
  </Card>
</CardGroup>

### 3. Format Your Code

Before committing, format your code:

```bash
black .
```

### 4. Test Your Changes

Run Splat locally to test:

```bash
# Test basic functionality
splat squash "python3 test.py"

# Test with context gathering
splat squash -r "python3 test.py"
```

### 5. Commit Your Changes

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add: brief description of your changes"
```

Commit message format:
- **Add:** New features
- **Fix:** Bug fixes
- **Update:** Improvements to existing features
- **Refactor:** Code restructuring
- **Docs:** Documentation changes

### 6. Push and Create Pull Request

```bash
git push origin feature/your-feature-name
```

Then create a pull request on GitHub with:
- Clear title describing the change
- Detailed description of what and why
- Reference to any related issues
- Screenshots or examples if applicable
